# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict cardiovascular disease risk using clinical and lifestyle data.

## Problem Statement
Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early prediction using patient health indicators can help enable preventive care and informed medical decisions.

## Dataset
Public cardiovascular dataset from Kaggle including:
- Age, gender
- Height, weight
- Systolic and diastolic blood pressure
- Cholesterol and glucose levels
- Smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and comparison

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree

## Results
- Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy
- Decision Tree performed well with strong interpretability
- Random Forest showed stable but lower performance

Detailed metrics and confusion matrices are available in the notebook and final report.
